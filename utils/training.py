    The function returns tensor that is of a size (width, height, num_classes) which
    is derived from annotation tensor with sizes (width, height) where value at
    each position represents a class. The functions requires a list with class
    values like [0, 1, 2 ,3] -- they are used to derive labels. Derived values will
    be ordered in the same way as the class numbers were provided in the list. Last
    value in the aforementioned list represents a value that indicate that the pixel
    should be masked out. So, the size of num_classes := len(class_labels) - 1.

    ----------
    annotation_tensor : Tensor of size (width, height)
        Tensor with class labels for each element
    class_labels : list of ints

        Tensor with labels for each pixel.
